## Simple and designer friendly

Web designers and HTML coders can make their job without any limitations. They can make a cms as if it is a static web site.<br>
`t2cms` is a `404` based forwarding controller architecture, so it is seamless for static contents and modifiable contents.


## Easy building

You can build CMS with just a few steps with this system without any programming.

### Define a object

This is similar to Database tables and represents a content data. Once you defined a object, you get a CRUD menu of it.

### Define a page 

Next step is to define a page which renders the data of each object. You can make three types of pages:

- `list page` This is for a list and search for all records of a object.
- `detail page` This is for a single record of a object.
- `form page` ex.) contact pages, etc.

### Edit a template

Last step of building CMS is to edit a template. It is just a `Smarty template`, so it's easy to learn and have many frexibility.
